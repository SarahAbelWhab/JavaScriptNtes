//------------- Some Definition --------\\

// syntax parser => a program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammer is valid

// Lexical Environment => where something sits physically in the code you write


// variable environ,ent => where the variable live

// Execution Context => a wrapper to  help manage the code that is running


// object => a collection of Name / value pairs


// Any Execution Context => ( Global object 'window' , 'this' , outer Environment , Your code )


// scope => where a variable is available in your code


// Execution Context is created in two phases ( Creation , Execution )
// Creation phase => ( Global object 'window' , 'this' , outer Environment , variables & functions ) 
// Execution phase => Run your code line by line


// Hoisting => setup Memory space for variables "set equal undefined" and functions "setup".


// JS is single threaded synchronous execution. 
// single threaded => one command is being executed at a time.
// synchronous => 'in programing' one at a time and in order
// Asynchronous => more than one at a time.

// execution context stack first, then Event queue


// Dynamic Typing => variables can hold different types of values because it's all figured out during execution.


// primitive type => a type of data that represents a single value
// ( undefined , null , boolean , number , string , symbol )

// operator => a special function that is syntactically written differently.
// ( operator take two parameter and return one result )    'a = 3 > 4'

// operator precedence => which operator function gets called first 'Higher precedence wins'
// Associativity => order called from 'Right-To-Left' or 'Left-to-Right'
// Coercion => converting a value from one type to another


// Json 'JavaScript object notation' => a standerd for structuring data that is inspired by javascript object literals

// Transpile => convert the syntax of one programming language to another


// Syntax sugar => 
// immutable =>
